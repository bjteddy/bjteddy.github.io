										<p>But I've got good news for ya: I'm a passionate student who is <span style="color:#323232; font-weight:bold;">curious</span> about all things by nature. I love learning. I believe that learning is the only thing in life that does not adhere to marginal utility. Learning simply never gets old. And that's what I love about it.</p>
								        <p>I am particularily passionate about doing <span style="color:#323232; font-weight:bold;">data driven</span> work. I enjoy coding, and I am constantly amazed by how programmers think.</p>
                                        <p>I like having a bird's eye view on everything that I do. Which is why I have enjoyed working as a <span style="color:#323232; font-weight:bold;">Project Manager</span> in the past. </p>
                                        <p>I also like working on tangible projects. I love big <span style="color:#323232; font-weight:bold;">aerostructures</span> and I aim to fly one soon!</p>

                            <p><span style="font-size:0.8em;">*** For confidentiality reasons, the full explanation behind this project cannot be disclosed.</span></p>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">role</span></p>
                            <p>During my time at <span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">Bombardier Aerospace</span>, I was responsible for managing an aircraft assembly project for business jet Global 5000/6000. I managed a <span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">team of 4 people</span>, and I got to work with aviation engineers, methods agents and quality inspectors.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">context</span></p>
                            <p><span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">A Life Limited Part (LLP)</span> is an aircraft part which has a pre-established life expectancy value. This value is measured by either hours of use or cycles of flight. A <span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">life expectancy value</span> indicates a Life Limited Part’s absolute maximum period of serviceability; a Life Limited Part must be dismounted from an aircraft before its life expectancy is due. This procedure is strictly enforced by <span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">Canadian Aviation Regulations</span>. Tracking Life Limited Parts internally within Bombardier ensures the company to use unexpired parts during the aircraft assembly process. Tracking Life Limited Parts also allows the company to collect and conserve the parts’ metadata internally, which can be delivered to aircraft buyers upon request. </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">problem</span></p>
                            <p>LLP’s traditionally had not been systematically tracked. This lack of tracking becomes problematic if and when a spanned LLP (an LLP with hours/cycles logged to it) is unidentifiable from an un-spanned one. Untracked LLP’s can potentially lead to safety liability and subsequently to <span style="color:#000; font-weight:bold;">business depreciation</span>. For example, a spanned LLP may unknowingly be assembled into a certified brand-new aircraft due to confusion in LLP inventory control. This results in having to re-inspect, re-assemble and re-certify the aircraft of concern, which are all subjected to cost and unnecessary expenditures on Bombardier’s behalf. More importantly, such an incidence may lead to loss of customer trust. Clients may question the quality, safety and engineering integrity of Bombardier aircrafts. Loss of customer trust can negatively impact aircraft sales and ultimately lead to business loss.</p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">workflow</span></p>
                            <p>Business aircraft assembly process is a long and complex one at Bombardier Aerospace. In order to get a bird's eye view on the general lean asssembly process, I mapped out the existing workflow. Here's how it looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <img src="images/Bombardier/1.png" align="middle;"/>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <p>Zooming in - I wanted to get more specific. In order to get a clear understanding of how a typical aircraft part is circulated during the assembly process, I mapped out a life-cycle-flow. Here's how it looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/2.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/4.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">system analysis</span></p>
                            <p>There were many engineering requirements and constraints to this project. These standards were to be met very strictly, because they were derived from various aviation safety protocols. Failing to meet even one compliance requirement would negatively impact Bombardier's engineering reliability.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Analyzing the typical assembly operation process of a travelling Life Limited Part was essential. I tackled the development using the unit-design process, where a problem is dissected to its smallest working core. In this particular case, I had to analyze how a single Life Limited Part moves around Bombardier facilities around the world. Here's how the analysis looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/5.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <p>Like most engineering disciplines, aviation relies heavily on accurate and detailed stock transferring process. Bombardier has hundreads of related stock sources around the world, and Life Limited Parts are required to be treated as parts of exception. This is how sotck-to-stock analysis roughly looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/6.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">prototyping</span></p>
                            <p>With a series of workflow and analysis in place, I developed a prototype for the LLP Tracking System using one-directional method. Aviation engineering process is costly, therefore efficiency and lean processing are the biggest virtues in the industry. One-directional prototyping fit the bill just right: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/7.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/8.png"/></div>
                            <br clear="all" />
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">project management</span></p>
                            <p>After prototype testing was completed, and the tracking system was approved by management, it was time for real development. As a Project Manager, I wanted to make full use of my resources (3 other team members). I partitioned the project into 5 bits: Project Charter, Business Case, Productized Solution, Operational Guide and Progress Update Module. Here is how some of my project management work looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/9.png"/></div>

                            <br>

                            <br>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">software design</span></p>
                            <p>As the team lead, I developed a full-stack architecture for the LLP Tracking System. I used Python to communicate between Bombardier's primary warehouse tool, SAP, and in-house master databae on Oracle. I developed an internal database at the Receiving department using MS SQL Server to capture incoming and outgoing LLP data. I also developed a simple masking GUI for data clerks who would populate the new database. Here is how software implementation briefly looked like: </p>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <div><img src="images/Bombardier/12.png"/></div>

                            <p><span style="font-size:3.8em">the big picture</span></p>
                            <p>The LLP Tracking System was completed and officially implemented to the assembly process during my time at Bombardier. It is an active system that is in use today and it insures that business jets Global 5000/6000 are built with the safest Life Limited Parts!  </p>
